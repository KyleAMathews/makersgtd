#represent character bindings as tree, once enter in tree, don't exit until reach leaf.
# Allow for global states, e.g. normal, input (don't do anything), a model is checked, etc
# global states in stack. Normal is always active. If model is active, it can choose
# which keys to override. If it doesn't override something, then things fallback
# to the next stack.

#if next keystroke doesn't match something, exit and start over again.

#e.g.
#     _i - call function navigateInbox
#   _|
#g |_
#    |_n - call function navigateNextActions
